# Get Started with HiveCode

Welcome to HiveCode! This guide will help you install, configure, and start
using the HiveCode to enhance your workflow right from your terminal.

## Quickstart: Install, authenticate, configure, and use HiveCode

HiveCode brings the power of advanced language models directly to your command
line interface. As an AI-powered assistant, HiveCode can help you with a variety
of tasks, from understanding and generating code to reviewing and editing
documents.

## Install

The standard method to install and run HiveCode uses `npm`:

```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

Once HiveCode is installed, run HiveCode from your command line:

```bash
gemini
```

For more installation options, see [HiveCode Installation](./installation.md).

## Authenticate

To begin using HiveCode, you must authenticate with a Google service. The most
straightforward authentication method uses your existing Google account:

1. Run HiveCode after installation:
   ```bash
   gemini
   ```
2. When asked "How would you like to authenticate for this project?" select **1.
   Login with Google**.
3. Select your Google account.
4. Click on **Sign in**.

For other authentication options and information, see

## Configure

HiveCode offers several ways to configure its behavior, including environment
variables, command-line arguments, and settings files.

To explore your configuration options, see
[HiveCode Configuration](./configuration.md).

## Use

Once installed and authenticated, you can start using HiveCode by issuing
commands and prompts in your terminal. Ask it to generate code, explain files,
and more.

To explore the power of HiveCode, see [HiveCode examples](./examples.md).
